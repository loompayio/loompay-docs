# **Loompay Referral Program**

**1. Overview**

The **Loompay Referral Program** is designed to reward users who help expand the Loompay ecosystem by inviting new members to join, activate cards, and start spending.

By sharing Loompay with others, users earn **crypto rewards**, unlock **higher commissions**, and gain exclusive partner privileges — while new users also enjoy **spending bonuses** during their first month.
## **2. How It Works**

Each Loompay user receives a **unique Referral Code** accessible inside the Loompay App.

When a new user (the **Referee**) signs up using this code, both the **Referrer** and **Referee** earn rewards after completing defined activation milestones.

| **Step** | **Action** | **Reward Trigger** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Referrer shares their referral link, QR, or code via social media | — |
| 2 | Referee signs up and completes KYC using the code | — |
| 3 | Referee activates their Loompay Virtual Card | Partial eligibility |
| 4 | Referee spends ≥ **$50 USD** (or crypto equivalent) within 30 days | Full reward for both users |

## **3. Reward Structure**

A **“Successful Referral”** occurs when a new user completes **KYC verification** and makes at least **one Top-Up (fund deposit)** into their Loompay account.

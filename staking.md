## Staking

Loompay's Staking & Liquidity program allows users to lock or commit USD-denominated assets or supported crypto tokens to earn rewards, unlock card and account benefits, and contribute liquidity to the Loompay ecosystem.

The program operates on two complementary tracks:

1. **Staking Assets:**
    
    Lock USD stablecoins or supported crypto tokens (e.g., USDC, USDT, LOOM) to earn passive rewards and unlock premium card features.
    
2. **Liquidity Contribution:**
    
    Participate in liquidity pools that power Loompay’s global spend infrastructure — bridging **crypto-to-fiat** payments securely and transparently.
    
    ## **Tiered Staking System**
    
    | Tier | Minimum Stake | Lock Duration | APR (Est.) | Early Unstake Fee | Perks & Rewards |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | **Bronze** | $200 | Flexible (no lock) | 5% | 1% | Basic rewards, 1% cashback boost |
    | **Silver** | $10,000 | 15 days | 7% | 2% | Higher cashback, increased card limits, priority support |
    | **Gold** | $100,000 | 30 days | 10% | 3% | Premium cashback, free card fees, VIP assistance |
    | **Business** | $1,000,000+ | 90 days or via LP Pool | Negotiable | Negotiable | Maximum yields, exclusive tier benefits, custom services |
    
    > All staking assets are valued in USD equivalent at the time of deposit.

## **Liquidity Pool Option — Crypto-backed Spending Credit**

### **1. Overview**

The **Liquidity Pool Option** lets users **stake crypto as collateral** and instantly access **USD credit** for real-world spending — **without selling their assets**.

Loompay’s liquidity engine automatically manages LTV ratios, risk thresholds, and liquidation safety via **real-time on-chain monitoring**.

> 💡 In short: You stake crypto, Loompay gives you USD to spend — safely, instantly, and transparently.

### **2. How It Works**

- User selects a supported crypto (e.g., BTC, ETH, SOL).
- The system calculates a **Loan-to-Value (LTV)** ratio and displays the available USD credit.
- USD credit is instantly deposited to the **Loompay Wallet/Card**.
- Continuous monitoring ensures collateral safety — if asset value drops below threshold, **partial or full liquidation** is triggered.
- User can **repay anytime**; collateral unlocks automatically upon full repayment.

### **Advance Ratios & Liquidation Parameters**

| Asset | Max LTV | Liquidation Trigger | Liquidation Type | Risk Profile |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **BTC** | 60% | >15% price drop | Partial | Stable, high liquidity |
| **ETH** | 55% | >20% price drop | Partial | Moderate volatility |
| **SOL** | 50% | >30% price drop | Full | High volatility |

---

**Example:**

- Stake 1 BTC ($110,000) → Receive $66,000 credit (LTV 60%)
- If BTC drops below $93,500 (−15%), auto-liquidation secures your position.

### **Funding Source & Capital Safety**

Loompay’s credit liquidity comes from two primary sources:

1. **Liquidity Providers (LPs):**
    
    Institutional and retail partners who stake USD stablecoins (USDC/USDT) into the **Credit Liquidity Pool (CLP)**.
    
2. **Protocol Reserve:**
    
    A dynamic on-chain treasury that absorbs temporary volatility and ensures real-time settlement for user withdrawals and card spend.
    

💼 **All credit advances are backed 1:1 by collateralized assets or liquidity reserves**, ensuring system solvency and transparency.

### **Fee & Interest Model**

| Fee Type | Description | Range |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Credit Interest (APR)** | Dynamic based on asset & market rate | 3–7% per year |
| **Liquidation Fee** | Applied only upon forced sell | 0.5–1% |
| **Early Repayment Fee** | None (repay anytime) | 0% |
| **Collateral Rebalancing Fee** | Optional if user extends collateral | 0.25% |

Users can choose between:

- **Flexible Borrowing:** Pay interest only on used balance.
- **Fixed-Term Staking Credit:** Lock for 15–60 days with 0% interest but capped credit limit.

---

### **4. User Benefits**

- 💰 **Spend without selling** crypto holdings.
- 🌍 **Use USD instantly** via Loompay virtual or physical card.
- 🔄 **Auto-repay mechanism:** deposits or transfers reduce loan balance automatically.
- 💸 **Earn staking rewards** on unborrowed collateral portions.
- 🔒 **Automated liquidation system** ensures user safety and pool stability.

## Guideline

1. Open **Loompay App → “Liquidity Option”** tab.
2. Select the crypto asset (BTC, ETH, SOL, etc.).
3. System displays:
    - Current market valuation
    - Advanceable USD amount
    - Liquidation threshold
4. User confirms → USD is instantly loaded into Loompay wallet/card.
5. Real-time tracking dashboard:
    - Current LTV ratio (%)
    - Market price of collateral
    - Liquidation risk indicator
6. **Early warnings** are sent when the asset approaches risk thresholds.
7. User can:
    - Add more collateral, or
    - Repay part of the loan to lower LTV.

### **Advance Ratios & Liquidation Thresholds**

| Asset Type | Max Advance Ratio (LTV) | Liquidation Trigger | Liquidation Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **BTC** | 60% | Price drop >15% | Partial liquidation | Stable & high liquidity asset |
| **ETH** | 55% | Price drop >20% | Partial liquidation | Balanced volatility |
| **SOL** | 50% | Price drop >30% | Full liquidation | Higher risk, lower buffer |

> 🧮 Example:
> 
> - User stakes **1 BTC = $110,000**
> - Receives **$66,000 USD** (LTV 60%) as spendable balance
> - If BTC price drops below $93,500 (−15%), auto-liquidation occurs to secure the pool.

## 2. How to Deposit (Top-Up)

**Step 1 — Access & Sign in**

Go to [**https://loompay.io**](https://loompay.io/) and sign in. From the homepage you can authenticate either by **email/password** or by using **“E-Connect Wallet”** to connect a supported crypto wallet.

**Step 2 — Start a Deposit**

Once signed in, open the dashboard and click the **Deposit** button.

**Step 3 — Choose Chain & Wallet**

Select the **blockchain (chain)** you want to deposit on (e.g., Ethereum, BSC, Tron). Then choose the corresponding wallet/address shown for that chain and send assets from your external wallet to the displayed address.

**Notes:**

- Always **double-check the selected chain and address**. Sending tokens to the wrong chain may result in permanent loss.
- Follow on-screen instructions for any **memo / tag / destination tag** required by the selected chain or token.
- Deposit confirmations depend on the blockchain — the app will display the deposit status and final credit once the required on-chain confirmations are reached.
- Some fiat/SEPA/Wire/ACH methods may require KYC verification before funds are credited.

## 3. How to Withdraw

**Step 1 — Sign in:** Log in at [**https://loompay.io**](https://loompay.io/) (email or E-Connect Wallet).

**Step 2 — Open Withdraw:** From the dashboard click **Withdraw**.

**Step 3 — Select Asset & Destination:** Choose the asset (crypto or fiat), pick the destination type (external wallet address for crypto) enter the amount, and confirm the destination details.

**Notes & Best Practices**

- For crypto withdrawals: ensure the **destination network matches the asset** (e.g., USDT on TRON vs USDT on Ethereum).
- For fiat withdrawals: ensure your **bank details** are matched exactly; some fiat withdrawals require additional verification and processing time.
- Withdrawals are subject to network fees, withdrawal limits, and KYC/AML checks as applicable.
